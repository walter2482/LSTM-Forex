# LSTM-Forex
This project provides tools for data management, financial data processing, visualization and machine learning. It includes statistical calculations, financial data download, technical indicators, autocorrelations and LSTM models to predict prices.

To create a virtual environment from the "requirements.txt" file and ensure that dependencies are installed correctly, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command line in the directory where the "requirements.txt" file is located.

Create a new virtual environment using the tool of your choice, such as virtualenv or conda. For example, with virtualenv, you can run the following command:

virtualenv myenv
This will create a new virtual environment named "myenv" in the current directory.

Activate the virtual environment. The activation process may vary depending on the operating system and the tool used. For virtualenv, you can use the following commands:


On Windows:

myenv\Scripts\activate
On Linux or macOS:

source myenv/bin/activate
Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the dependencies using the "requirements.txt" file. Run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the dependencies specified in the "requirements.txt" file into your virtual environment.

Great! Now you have a virtual environment set up with the required dependencies for your project.

You can execute your code within this virtual environment to ensure that all the dependencies are available and working correctly.

Remember, it is always a good practice to keep your virtual environment separate from the global system environment to avoid conflicts and ensure the reproducibility of your project.

To structure the publication on GitHub, you can follow these steps:

Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking on the "New" button on the repository page.

Give your repository a name and provide an optional description.

Choose the visibility of your repository (public or private).

Optionally, you can initialize the repository with a README file. You can choose to create the README file now or add it later.

Once the repository is created, you can go to the repository's main page.

Click on the "Add file" button and select "Upload files" to upload your project files, including the "requirements.txt" file.

After uploading the files, you can provide a commit message and click on the "Commit changes" button to save the files to your repository.

Now, other users can access your repository, view the code, and download the "requirements.txt" file if needed.

Remember to include any additional documentation or instructions in your repository's README file to guide users on how to set up the environment and use your project.
